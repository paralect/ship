# Overview

Keeping your public API up to date can be a cumbersome task that requires manually updating files. Our solution eliminates this hassle by allowing you to document your code itself, so you can focus on development without worrying about API updates.

The example demonstrates how to add Api public docs and the components included in the Ship to build a web application that supports documentation of API with Open API specification.
The example includes documentation and sample code that will help the developer in the process of integrating with the Ship template.
