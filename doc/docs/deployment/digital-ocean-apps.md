# Digital Ocean Apps

There is a simplified deployment type without Kubernetes. This type is **recommended** for most new applications because it allows you to set up infrastructure faster and doesn't require additional DevOps knowledge from the development team. You can switch to a more complex Kubernetes solution when your application will be at scale.

It's a step-by-step Ship deployment guide. We will use the [Digital Ocean Apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automated deployment. [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/try-free/) for databases deployment, and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for DNS and SSL configuration.

You need to create [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) and [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/try-free/) accounts.

Also, you need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you already haven't.

:::tip
[Migrator](https://github.com/docs/migrator.md) and [Scheduler](https://github.com/docs/scheduler.md) will run in a Docker container for API. Unlike [Kubernetes](https://github.com/docs/deployment/kubernetes/digital-ocean.md), where separate containers are used for them.
:::

## Setup project

First, initialize your project. Type ```npx create-ship-app init``` in the terminal then choose desired build type and **Digital Ocean Apps** as a cloud service provider.

![Init project](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/init-project.png)

You will have next project structure.

```shell
/my-app
  /apps
    /web
    /api
  /.github
  ...
```

Create GitHub private repository and upload source code.

![Private repo](/img/deployment/digital-ocean/private-repo.png)

```shell
cd my-app
git remote add origin https://github.com/Oigen43/my-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## MongoDB Atlas

Navigate to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/), sign in to your account and create a new database.

### Database creation

1. Select the appropriate type. Dedicated for a production environment, shared for staging/demo.
2. Select provider and region. We recommend selecting the same or closest region to the DO application.
3. Select cluster tier. Free M0 Sandbox should be enough for staging/demo environments. For production environment we recommended selecting the option that supports cloud backups, M10 or higher.
4. Enter cluster name

![Mongo cluster](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/mongo-create.png)

### Security and connection

After cluster creation, you'll need to set up security. Select the authentication type (username and password) and create a user.

![Mongo setup authentication](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/mongo-create-password.png)

Add IP addresses list, which should have access to your cluster. Add 0.0.0.0/0 IP address to allow anyone with credentials to connect.

![Mongo setup ip white list](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/mongo-create-ip-list.png)

After database creation, go to the dashboard page and get the URI connection string by pressing the `connect` button.

![Mongo dashboard](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/mongo-dashboard.png)

Select `Connect your application` option. Choose driver and mongo version, and copy connection string. Don't forget to replace `<password>` with your credentials.

![Mongo connect dialog](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/mongo-connection-string.png)

Save this value. It will be needed later when creating the app in Digital Ocean.

## Redis Cloud

Navigate to [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/try-free/) and create an account. Select cloud provider and region, then press `Let's start free` to finish database creation.

![Redis create database](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/redis-creation.png)

Open database settings and get the database public endpoint and password.

![Redis public endpoint](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/redis-public-endpoint.png)
![Redis password](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/redis-password.png)

Form Redis connection string using public endpoint and password `redis://:<password@<public-endpoint>`. Save this value. It will be needed later when creating the app in Digital Ocean.

## Digital Ocean

Navigate to the Digital Ocean Control Panel and select the **Apps** tab. The `Full-Stack` build type requires 2 applications. First for [Web](/docs/web/overview) and second for [API](/docs/api/overview), [Migrator](https://github.com/docs/migrator.md), and [Scheduler](https://github.com/docs/scheduler.md) services.

### Initial step
1. Select GitHub as a service provider. You might need to grant Digital Ocean access to your GitHub account.
2. Select the repository with the application.
3. Select a branch for deployment.
4. Select the source directory if the code is in a subfolder.It should `apps/web` for web application and `apps/api` for api.
5. Turn off the Autodeploy option. The Ship uses GitHub Actions for CI due to the poor support of monorepos in the Digital Ocean Apps

![Create app screen](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-create-app.png)

### Resources setup
1. Delete duplicated resources without dockerfile if you have one.
2. Select desired plan. For staging/demo environments, sufficiently selecting a basic plan for 5$. For production, you might consider selecting a more expensive plan.

![Create app resources](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-create-app-step-2.png)

### Environment variables
1. Add `APP_ENV` responsible for the config file from the environment folder that will be used when building your application.

| APP_ENV       | File          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| development   | development.json  |
| development-docker   | development-docker.json  |
| staging       | staging.json  |
| production    | production.json  |

2. Add other environment variables.

Variables, added in the `Global` section will be available to all resources within the application, while ones added in the `ship` section will be available only for that resource. Adding `MONGO_CONNECTION` in the global section allows you to use it later if you decide to set up migrator/scheduler resources

![Create app environment variables](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-create-app-step-3.png)

### Application name and hosted region
* [**Optional**] Select desired application name and/or region for your application

![Create app host](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-create-app-step-4.png)

### Review
Verify everything is correct and create a new resource.

After the application creation, you'll land on the application dashboard page. On dashboard, you can see application status, check runtime logs, track deployment status, and manage application settings.

### App Spec
Digital Ocean sets the path to Dockerfiles to the root by default. You will need to change it manually.
Navigate to Settings, expand the App spec tab and change `dockerfile_path` in the editor.

To deploy your application in a monorepo, it's essential to modify the `source_dir` parameter to the root directory.
This adjustment is necessary to ensure the correct configuration and operation of the applications within the monorepo.

## Cloudflare

Navigate to your Digital ocean application and open `Settings` tab. Select `Domains` row to open domain settings and click `Add domain` button

![Digital Ocean domains](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-domains.png)

Type your desired domain and select option `You manage your domain`

In the bottom section you'll be asked to copy CNAME alias of your digital ocean application name to record in your dns provider.
Copy that alias and leave the form (do no close it or submit).

![Digital Ocean new domain](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-new-domain.png)

Navigate to [CloudFlare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and sign into account.

1. Go to `DNS` tab and create a new record.
2. Click `Add record`. Select type `CNAME`,  enter domain name (must be the same you entered in digital ocean settings) and paste alias into `target` field.
Make sure `Proxy status` toggle enabled.
3. Save changes

![Cloudflare DNS](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/cloudflare-create-dns.png)

Now go back to digital ocean and submit form. It usually takes about 5 minutes for digital ocean to confirm and start using your new domain.
Once domain is confirmed, application can be accessed by new address.

## GitHub Actions

You can find two github actions in the `.github/workflows` folder, responsible for triggering deployment when you push changes in your repository. If you chose frontend or backend on the initialization step, you'll have one github workflow for the selected application type.

These actions require a Digital Ocean access token and application ID. Respectively these are `DO_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `DO_API_STAGING_APP_ID`/`DO_WEB_STAGING_APP_ID`/`DO_API_PRODUCTION_APP_ID`/`DO_WEB_PRODUCTION_APP_ID`.

Navigate to digital ocean and open the **API** tab on the left sidebar.
Click **Generate new token** and choose name and expiration period, and leave checkboxes as they are.

![Do access token create](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-access-token-create.png)

You'll see generated token in the list. Do not forget to copy the value and store it in a safe place. You won't be able to copy value after leaving the page.

![Do access token copy](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-access-token-copy.png)

Next, navigate to the **Apps** tab in the left sidebar and open your Digital Ocean application. You can find the id of your application id in the browser address bar.

![Do application id](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-application-id.png)

Now you can add theese keys to your github repository's secrets.

Navigate to the GitHub repository page, and open the **Settings** tab and these values. You have to be repository **admin** or **owner** to open this tab.

![Github secrets](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/github-secrets.png)

Done! Application deployed and can be accessed by provided domain.

![Deployed application](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/deployed-application.png)

## Set up migrator and scheduler (Optional)

Digital Ocean Apps allows configuring additional resources within one application, which can serve as background workers and jobs, and a scheduler to run before/after the deployment process.

Navigate to your Digital Ocean application. **Make sure to select the application with API server**, open a `Create` dropdown menu in the top-right corner, and select the `Create Resources From Source Code` option.

![Do create resource](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-create-resource.png)

1. Select a project repository, add a path to the source directory, disable auto-deploy, and press `Next`.

![Create resource screen](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-resource-form.png)

2. Delete a resource without Dockerfile and edit second by clicking on the pencil icon.

![Create app resources](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-create-resource-step-2.png)

3. In the edit resource form, select `Resource Type` - `Job`, `Before every deploy`, and change the name of the resource (not required, but might be useful later). Press save and go back to the resources screen.

![Edit resource screen](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-resource-type.png)

4. Select the `Add Additional Resource from Source` option below the list of added resources, repeat steps 1-2, and navigate to the edit form for a new resource.

5. Select `Resource Type` - `Worker`, save changes and go back.

![Edit resource screen](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-resource-type-2.png)

6. Proceed with the next steps, add environment variables if needed, verify a new monthly cost of the application and create resources.

You can find created resources in the `overview` tab.

![Resources overview screen](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-resources-overview.png)

7. Navigate to Application Spec `(settings tab)`. Change the `dockerfile_path` variable to files with migrator and scheduler. Migrator is placed in the `jobs` section. You can also find it by name of the resource. The scheduler is placed in the `workers` section.

![Migrator spec screen](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-migrator-app-spec.png)

![Scheduler spec screen](/img/deployment/digital-ocean-apps/do-scheduler-app-spec.png)
