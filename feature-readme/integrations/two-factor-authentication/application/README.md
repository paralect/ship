## Common flow of two factor authentication(2fa) by app:

1. User enables 2fa in web site on security page. He scans qr code by auth application that will generate entrance codes for 2fa strategy
1. Next login user will be asked to input 2fa codes that are generated by auth application
1. If user need to disable 2fa he should login and visit security page where he can disable 2fa

> Github recommends using an application such as [Authy](https://authy.com/guides/github/), [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/), or [LastPass Authenticator](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/lastpass-authenticator-lp030014). These applications support secure backup of your authentication codes in the cloud and can be restored if you lose access to your device.
