A toolkit for makers to ship better products faster üöÄ.
[Ship](https://github.com/paralect/ship) is a tool which help you setup your new product in matter of minutes. Ship is based on Stack. Stack is an number of open-source components, resulted from years of hard work on a number of awesome products. We carefully select, document and share our production-ready knowledge with you.

If you're looking to start your new product based on Ship we'd be happy to provide you with a free consultation. Contact Paralect at andrew@paralect.com.

## Why Ship?

Shipping is crucial part of any new product. The quicker you ship, the more time you have to validate your hypotheses. The quicker you validate your idea, the sooner you know if you're building what people want.

In the rush, developers often ignore quality. Backups, monitoring, proper data validation and many other things seems not so important in the beginning. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes not.

We believe we could ship great products faster, while maintain decent quality and have a plan for scaling when hypotheses where right.

## Core concepts

* Ship is based on 20+ tiny components. We manually combine them together and test upon new release.
* Every component is kept is tiny as possible to simplify maintenance and stay up to date with new releases.
* Ship is always in production ready state.

## Ship components

TODO: list all components used to build current Ship version. Make a release after this.
