[Ship](https://github.com/paralect/ship) is based on Stack. Stack is an open-source (soon!) toolkit based on Node.JS, React.JS, PostCSS & friends.
The Stack is result of 5 years of hard work on a number of awesome products.

Shipping is crucial part of any new product. The quicker you ship, the more time you have to validate your hypotheses. The quicker you validate your idea, the sooner you know if you're building what people want.

In the rush, developers often ignore quality. Backups, monitoring, proper data validation, etc seems not so important in the beginning. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes not.

We believe we could ship great products faster, while maintain decent quality and have a plan for scaling when hypotheses where right.
