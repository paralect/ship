The [Ship](https://ship.paralect.com) is a toolkit for makers to **ship** better products faster 🚀.  

It is based on several open-source components, resulting from years of hard work by the [Paralect](https://www.paralect.com) team. We carefully select, document, and share our production-ready knowledge with you. Our technological choices are based on the following main tools: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/), [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

We encourage developers to share production-ready solutions and help businesses ship something people need as quickly as possible.

## Why Ship?

Shipping is a crucial part of any new product. The quicker you ship, the more time you have to validate your hypotheses. The quicker you validate your idea, the sooner you know if you're building what people want.

In the rush, developers often ignore quality. Backups, monitoring, proper data validation and many other things seems not so important in the beginning. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're not.

We believe we could ship great products faster while maintaining decent quality, and have a plan for scaling when hypotheses were right.

## Core concepts

* We automatically build Ship using a number of smaller components. Our ultimate goal is to include only the parts you need for your product development.
* Every component is kept as tiny as possible to simplify maintenance and stay up to date with new releases. 
* Ship is always in a production-ready state. We test every release manually to provide a great developer experience. We use Ship to build our products, see more [here](https://www.paralect.com/companies).
