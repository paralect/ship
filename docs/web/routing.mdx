title: "Routing"
---

Our application's routing is powered by [Next.js Pages router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages), which is a standard for handling routes in Next.js applications.

## Configuration in `routes.ts`

Each route in our application is configured in the `routes.ts` file, located in the root of the `routes` directory.
This file defines the structure and access levels of all routes using the `routesConfiguration` object.

### Scope and Layout Types

Routes are categorized into two scope types and layout types:

1. **Scope Types**:
- `PUBLIC`: Routes accessible without user authentication.
- `PRIVATE`: Routes requiring user authentication.

2. **Layout Types**:
- `MAIN`: Main layout for authenticated users.
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Layout for non-authenticated users or authentication pages.

### Route Configuration Example

Here's an example of how a private and a public route are configured:

- Private Route (Requires authentication):
```tsx src/routes.ts
[RoutePath.Profile]: {
  scope: ScopeType.PRIVATE,
  layout: LayoutType.MAIN,
}
```

- Public Route (Accessible without authentication):
```tsx src/routes.ts
[RoutePath.ForgotPassword]: {
  scope: ScopeType.PUBLIC,
  layout: LayoutType.UNAUTHORIZED,
},
```

## Page Configuration

The PageConfig (`/pages/_app/PageConfig/index.tsx` file) plays a crucial role in applying these configurations.
It uses the route configuration from `routes.ts` to determine the appropriate scope and layout for each page.

### How It Works

- The `PageConfig` component, using the Next.js router, matches the current route against the `routesConfiguration`.
- Based on the route, it applies the designated scope and layout.
- For private routes, it redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.
- Conversely, for public routes, authenticated users are redirected to the home page.

## Naming Conventions for Route Files

- **Page Routes**: Each file representing a page route should have the `.page.tsx` postfix.
- **API Routes/Middleware**: Files for Next.js API routes or middleware should have the `.api.ts` postfix.

<Note>
These conventions can be modified in `next.config.js` if needed.

By following this structure, our application maintains a clear, manageable, and scalable routing system.
