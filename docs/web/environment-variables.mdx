title: Environment Variables
---

## Overview

We use different environment variables for different stages like developing, testing, and when the app is live.

This is done by using special files that have environments in them.

### How the App Chooses the Right Environment Variables File
The app knows which file to use based on a special environment variable called `APP_ENV`.

If `APP_ENV` is set to **staging**, the app will use the variables from the staging file.

    In this stage, we work on making the app and adding new things.

    The app uses a file named `.env.development` which has special environment variables just for people who are building the app.

    Here, we test the app to make sure it's ready to go live.

    We use the `.env.staging` file which has variables that help us test everything properly.

    In the Production, the app is all done and people can use it.

    App uses a file named `.env.production` which has environment variables for the app when it's being used by everyone.

### Environment Variables Schema Validation
We use [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to check that our config is correct and in the right format.
This is important to make sure the app works without any problems.

This setup is found in the `src/config/index.ts` file.

<Tip>
To prefix any variables intended for client-side exposure with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
</Tip>

When we add new environment variables to .env files, we need to make sure they match what we set up in the `Zod` schema.

## Adding a New Variable

Here's how to add a new environment variable to the application:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Identify the Environment Stages">
        Determine the environment stages where the new variable will be used.

        Refer to the following table for file associations:

        | APP_ENV     | File             |
        |-------------|------------------|
        | development | .env.development |
        | staging     | .env.staging     |
        | production  | .env.production  |
    </Step>

    <Step title="Update `.env` Files">
        Add the new variable to the respective `.env` files. For client-side variables, prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

        ```bash
        NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Modify the Schema in `src/config/index.ts`">
        Update the schema in the `config/index.ts` file to include the new variable.
        This step is crucial for schema validation.

        ```typescript config/index.ts
        const schema = z.object({
            ...
            STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: z.string(),
        });
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Update the Configuration Object">
        Add the new variable to the configuration object within the same file (`config/index.ts`), ensuring it matches the schema.

        ```typescript config/index.ts
        const processEnv = {
            ...
            STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
        };
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
    All the environment variables we use in the front-end part of our app can be seen by everyone.
    So, don't put any secret stuff like passwords or private keys there.

    Keep those safe and only on the server side! üõ°Ô∏è‚ú®
