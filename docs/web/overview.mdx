Web Starter is our starting point for React front-end applications.
It's crafted using a selection of advanced technologies and tools, making it a robust and efficient foundation for development.

The core technologies include:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework that supports features like server-side rendering, static site generation and routing.
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query): A library for managing data fetching, caching, and updating in React apps.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) + [Zod](https://zod.dev/): Efficient form management and schema validation tools.
- [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) + [Tabler](https://tabler-icons.io/): UI components and icons for responsive and accessible web interfaces.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): JavaScript with syntax for types, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
