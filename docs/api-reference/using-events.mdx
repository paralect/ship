# Using events

We are using events to keep our systems simple and use the [full power of denormalized data in MongoDB.](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/6-rules-of-thumb-for-mongodb-schema-design-part-2) Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more tables. It can help us avoid costly joins in a database. You can find a simple example of this technique below.

In Ship, every resource produces events on create, update and delete database operations. As a result, we have all events in one place and these events describe system behavior. Stripe has [an event for any change](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types) that happens in their system. We do pretty much the same.
