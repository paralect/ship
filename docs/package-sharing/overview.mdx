Ship is monorepo, so it lets you share your code across applications to minimize duplications and reduce errors.
All shared code are inside **packages/** folder.

By default, packages include app-constants, app-types, enums, schemas and mailer. Learn more about the **mailer**  package [here](/mailer).

```shell
/packages
  /app-constants
  /app-types
  /enums
  /mailer
  /schemas
```

## Installation

We've included all essential packages in your apps.
If you want to add more packages, head to the `package.json` file, and in the dependencies section, add to **dependencies** package name with value "workspace:*".

```json apps/web/package.json
"dependencies": {
    "app-constants": "workspace:*",
    "app-types": "workspace:*",
    "schemas": "workspace:*",
  },
```
<Tip>
  The **enums** package comes with **app-types**, so no separate import is needed.

You can read more about **package sharing**  in [Turborepo documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/sharing-code/internal-packages).
