## Overview

Our technological choices based on the following main tools: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/), [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Starting application with Turborepo

To run infra and all services -- just run: `npm start` 🚀

### Turborepo: Running infra and services separately

1. Start base infra services in Docker containers:

```bash
npm run infra
```

2. Run services with Turborepo

```bash
npm turbo-start
```

## Using Ship with Docker

To run infra and all services -- just run: `npm run docker` 🚀

### Docker: Running infra and services separately

1. Start base infra services in Docker containers:

```bash
npm run infra
```

2. Run services you need:

```bash
./bin/start.sh api web
```

You can also run infra services separately with `./bin/start.sh` bash script.
