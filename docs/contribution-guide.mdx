## Documentation

We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for creating documentation. It is in `docs/` folder.

The docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format. See [Github Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
and [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) to get known with this syntax.

### How to run documentation

1. Install Mintlify globally.

<Warning>
  Node.js version should be 19.00.0 or higher.
</Warning>

```shell
pnpm i -g mintlify
```

2. Execute the following command in project root directory:

```shell
pnpm run docs
```

Documentation will be opened on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if it's unused.

## Ship template structure

Template of project are in `template/` folder. It contains all necessary files and folder for project.
Let's describe folders:

- **.github** - contains scripts for github actions
- **.husky** - contains script that will run before commit and check for eslint errors
- **.vscode** - VS Code settings
- **apps** - contains [API](/api-reference/overview.mdx) and [WEB](/web/overview.mdx)
- **bin** - contains scripts for setting up and starting project
- **packages** - contains packages with shared code. More about it in our [documentation](/package-sharing/overview.mdx)

### How to run Ship template

1. Go to `template` folder:
```shell
cd template
```

2. Open `apps/api` and copy **.env.example** file with name .env

3. Install dependencies

```shell
pnpm i
```

4. Set up and start project

```shell
pnpm run start
```

**API** will work on 3001 port, **WEB** - 3002 port and **Mailer** - 3003.

### Deployment

Ship can be deployed on 4 platforms: **AWS**, **Digital Ocean Kubernetes**, **Digital Ocean Apps** and **Render**.
Setting for deployments are in `deploy` folder in appropriate folders.

During installing a project via `npx create-ship-app` user can choose deployment type and setting from an appropriate folder will be added to theirs project in `deploy` folder.

To check deployment you need to create new project via `npx create-ship-app` command and try to deploy app in your environment with [deployment instructions](/deployment).
