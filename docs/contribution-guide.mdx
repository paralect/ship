2. Set up the project locally.
3. Create a new branch from the `master` branch, using a name that describes your changes.
4. Implement your changes and create a commit.
5. Open a pull request.
6. Attach 3 labels:
  - "To Review" - indicates that the task is ready for review.
  - Functionality type - specify a type (Feature, Bug, or Improvement).
  - Edit location - specify the area of modification (docs, create-ship-app, node-mongo or template).

Your pull request will be checked by our team. If everything is well, it will be merged to `master` branch.
If there are suggestions, we'll leave comments and label it "Changes Requested". You'll get an email to let you know.
Once you've implemented the necessary changes, please reattach the "To Review" tag.

## Documentation

We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for documentation, located in the `/docs` folder.

The docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format. Check out the [Github Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
and [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) to become familiar with this syntax.

### How to run documentation

1. Install Mintlify globally.

<Warning>
  Ensure that your Node.js version is 19.00.0 or higher.
</Warning>

```shell
pnpm i -g mintlify
```

2. Execute the following command in the project's root directory:

```shell
pnpm run docs
```

Documentation will be opened on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if it's not in use.

## Packages

Within the `/package` folder, you'll find two essential packages: `create-ship-app` and `node-mongo`.

**create-ship-app** is simple CLI tool for bootstrapping Ship applications. Downloads actual template from Ship monorepo and configures it to run.
Learn more in the [documentation](/packages/create-ship-app.mdx).

**node-mongo** is lightweight reactive extension to official Node.js MongoDB [driver](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.10/).
It's used in the Ship template, and you can find details in the [documentation](/packages/node-mongo.mdx).

## Ship template structure

The project template is in the `/template` folder and includes all necessary files and folders.

Let's explore the structure:

- **.github** - contains scripts for Github actions.
- **.husky** - contains a script that runs before committing and checks for ESLint errors.
- **.vscode** - VS Code settings.
- **apps** - contains [API](/api-reference/overview.mdx) and [WEB](/web/overview.mdx).
- **bin** - contains scripts for setting up and starting the project.
- **packages** - contains packages with shared code. Find more details about package sharing in our [documentation](/package-sharing/overview.mdx).

### How to run Ship template

1. Navigate to the `/template` folder:
```shell
cd template
```

2. In `/apps/api`, copy the **.env.example** file with the name **.env**.

3. Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm i
```

4. Set up and start project

```shell
pnpm run start
```

The **API** will work on port 3001, **WEB** on port 3002, and **Mailer** on port 3003.

### Deployment

Ship can be deployed on four platforms: **AWS**, **Digital Ocean Kubernetes**, **Digital Ocean Apps**, and **Render**. Deployment settings are in the `/deploy` folder within the respective folders.

When installing a project via `npx create-ship-app`, users can choose the deployment type, and the appropriate settings from the respective folder will be added to their project in the `/deploy` folder.

To check deployment, create a new project via `npx create-ship-app` and attempt to deploy the app in your environment using the  [deployment instructions](/deployment).
