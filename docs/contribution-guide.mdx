## Documentation

We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for creating documentation. It is in `docs/` folder.

The docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format. See [Github Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
and [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) to get known with this syntax.

### How to run documentation

1. Install Mintlify globally.

<Warning>
  Node.js version should be 19.00.0 or higher.
</Warning>

```shell
pnpm i -g mintlify
```

2. Execute the following command in project root directory:

```shell
pnpm run docs
```

Documentation will be opened on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if it's unused.
