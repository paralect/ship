## Documentation

We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for documentation, located in the `docs/` folder.

The docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format. Check out the [Github Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
and [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) to become familiar with this syntax.

### How to run documentation

1. Install Mintlify globally.

<Warning>
  Ensure that your Node.js version is 19.00.0 or higher.
</Warning>

```shell
pnpm i -g mintlify
```

2. Execute the following command in the project's root directory:

```shell
pnpm run docs
```

Documentation will be opened on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if it's not in use.

## Ship template structure

The project template is in the `template/` folder and includes all necessary files and folders.

Let's explore the structure:

- **.github** - contains scripts for Github actions.
- **.husky** - contains a script that runs before committing and checks for ESLint errors.
- **.vscode** - VS Code settings.
- **apps** - contains [API](/api-reference/overview.mdx) and [WEB](/web/overview.mdx).
- **bin** - contains scripts for setting up and starting the project.
- **packages** - contains packages with shared code. Find more details about package sharing in our [documentation](/package-sharing/overview.mdx).

### How to run Ship template

1. Navigate to the `template` folder:
```shell
cd template
```

2. In `apps/api`, copy the **.env.example** file with the name **.env**.

3. Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm i
```

4. Set up and start project

```shell
pnpm run start
```

The **API** will work on port 3001, **WEB** on port 3002, and **Mailer** on port 3003.

### Deployment

Ship can be deployed on four platforms: **AWS**, **Digital Ocean Kubernetes**, **Digital Ocean Apps**, and **Render**. Deployment settings are in the `deploy` folder within the respective folders.

When installing a project via `npx create-ship-app`, users can choose the deployment type, and the appropriate settings from the respective folder will be added to their project in the `deploy` folder.

To check deployment, create a new project via `npx create-ship-app` and attempt to deploy the app in your environment using the  [deployment instructions](/deployment).
