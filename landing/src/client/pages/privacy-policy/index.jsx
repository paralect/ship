        <h2>5. OTHER ACCESS TO OR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

        <p>
          The Offerings may also contain links to third party websites. This
          Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Us. Even if
          the third party is affiliated with Us through a business partnership
          or otherwise, We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such
          third party. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy
          policies of such third parties to determine how they handle any information
          they separately collect from you. Please be aware that We do not warn
          you when you choose to click through to another website when using the
          Offerings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Websites contain features that enable you to post reviews, comments
          or other content that is publicly viewable. You should be aware that
          any personal information you submit as part of those posts can be read,
          collected, or used by other visitors to the Websites, and could be used
          to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal
          information you choose to publicly post on the Websites.

          <span className={styles.chapter}>
            Opt-Outs.
          </span>
          We may provide you with the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your
          personal information used for certain purposes when We ask for this
          information. If you decide to opt-out, We may not be able to provide
          certain features of the Offerings to you.
        </p>

          </span>
          If you no longer wish to receive Our newsletter and promotional
          communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the
          instructions included on such communications or on the Offerings.
          Please note, however, that you may be unable to opt-out of certain

            Blocking Cookies.
          </span>

          <span className={styles.chapter}>
            How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.
          </span>
          Your Web browser may have a &quot;do not track&quot; setting which,
          when enabled, causes your browser to send a do not track HTTP header
          file or &quot;signal&quot; to each site you visit. At present, the
          Offerings do not respond to this type of signal.
        </p>

        <h2>7. ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

        <p>
          When you use the Offerings, We make good faith efforts to provide you
          with access to your personal information upon your request and either
          provide you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate
          or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise
          required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
          You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your
          information at any time. To do so, please contact Us at support@ship.com
          with your name and the information requested to be accessed, corrected
          or removed, or if you are using the Service, sign in to your account,
          go to your profile, and make the desired changes. We may decline to
          process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
          disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning
          information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others,
          would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise
          required. In any case where We provide information access and correction,
          We perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require
          a disproportionate effort.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note that if you cease using the Service or We terminate your
          access to the Service in accordance with Ship Subscription Terms of
          Service, you may no longer have the ability to access or update your
          information.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may retain your information as necessary to support the Offerings,
          comply with Our legal obligations or resolve disputes. Note that content
          you post may remain on the Offerings even if you cease using the
          Offerings or We terminate your access to the Offerings.
        </p>

        <h2>8. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

          technology. No method of transmission over the Internet, method of
          electronic storage or other security methods are one hundred percent
